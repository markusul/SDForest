Spectral Deconfounded Random Forests (SDForest) is a method for estimating non-linear sparse causal effects in the presence of unobserved confounding. SDForest has been shown to be a nice estimate for the true causal function in such settings, if we observe many covariates, e.g. high-dimensional setting, and we have fairly sparse confounding. <span style="color:red">Referenzen SDForest, DDL</span>

## Installation

You can install the development version of SDForest from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("markusul/SDForest")
```

## Usage

This is a basic example on how to estimate the causal effect of $X$ on $Y$ using SDForest. You can learn more about analyzing sparse causal effects estimated by SDForest in `vignette("SDForest")`.

```{r SDForest}
library(SDForest)

set.seed(42)
# simulation of confounded data
sim_data <- simulate_data_nonlinear(q = 2, p = 50, n = 100, m = 2)
X <- sim_data$X
Y <- sim_data$Y
train_data <- data.frame(X, Y)
# causal parents
sim_data$j

fit <- SDForest(Y ~ ., train_data)
fit
```

You can also estimate just one Spectral Deconfounded Regression Tree using the `SDTree` function.

```{r SDTree}
causal_Tree <- SDTree(Y ~ ., train_data, cp = 0.03)

# plot the causal tree
causal_Tree
plot(causal_Tree)
```
