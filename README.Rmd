Spectrally Deconfounded Random Forests (SDForest) is a method for estimating non-linear sparse direct effects in the presence of unobserved confounding. SDForest has shown to be a good estimate for the true direct effect, if we observe many covariates, e.g. high-dimensional setting, and we have fairly dense confounding (@Ulmer, @Guo2022DoublyConfounding, @Cevid2020SpectralModels). Even if the assumptions are violated, there is not much to lose and SDForest will, in general, estimate a function closer to $f^0$ than classical Random Forests.

## Installation

You can install the development version of SDForest from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("markusul/SDForest")

# or
# install.packages('pak')
# pak::pkg_install('markusul/SDForest')
```

## Usage

This is a basic example on how to estimate the direct effect of $X$ on $Y$ using SDForest. You can learn more about analyzing sparse direct effects estimated by SDForest in `vignette("SDForest")`.

```{r SDForest}
library(SDForest)

set.seed(42)
# simulation of confounded data
sim_data <- simulate_data_nonlinear(q = 2, p = 50, n = 100, m = 2)
X <- sim_data$X
Y <- sim_data$Y
train_data <- data.frame(X, Y)
# parents
sim_data$j

fit <- SDForest(Y ~ ., train_data)
fit
```

You can also estimate just one Spectrally Deconfounded Regression Tree using the `SDTree` function. See also `vignette("SDTree")`.

```{r SDTree}
Tree <- SDTree(Y ~ ., train_data, cp = 0.03)

# plot the tree
Tree
plot(Tree)
```
