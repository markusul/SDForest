to screen for causal parents of a continuous response in a large set of
observed covariates, even in the presence of hidden confounding. We also
provide methods to asses the functional partial dependence of the
response on the causal parents.</p>

<p>Given the estimated causal function, the first question we might want
to answer is which of the covariates are the causal parents of the
response. If we intervene on the causal parents, we expect the response
to change. For that, we can estimate the functional dependency of
<math display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mi>Y</mi><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">Y</annotation></semantics></math>
on
<math display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mi>X</mi><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">X</annotation></semantics></math>,
<math display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mover><mrow><mi>f</mi><mrow><mo stretchy="true" form="prefix">(</mo><mi>X</mi><mo stretchy="true" form="postfix">)</mo></mrow></mrow><mo accent="true">̂</mo></mover><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\widehat{f(X)}</annotation></semantics></math>
and examine which covariates are important in this function. We can
directly compare the importance pattern of the deconfounded estimator to
the classical random forest estimated by <a href="https://imbs-hl.github.io/ranger/" class="external-link">ranger</a>. This comparison to
the plain counterpart always gives a feeling of the strength of
confounding. If no confounding exists, <code><a href="../reference/SDForest.html">SDForest()</a></code> and
<code><a href="http://imbs-hl.github.io/ranger/reference/ranger.html" class="external-link">ranger::ranger()</a></code> should result in similar models.</p>
<p>In the graph below, we see the variable importance
<code><a href="../reference/varImp.SDForest.html">varImp()</a></code> of the deconfounded random forest against the
plain random forest. The scale has no meaning, but we see how the true
causal parents in red is getting a clear higher variable importance for
the SDForest. The plain random forest cannot distinguish between
spurious correlation and true causation.</p>

<p>Before, we looked at the variable importance of the non-regularized
SDForest. We have two more techniques to better understand which
variables might be causally important. The first is the regularization
path <code><a href="../reference/regPath.SDForest.html">regPath()</a></code>, where we plot the variable importance
against varying regularization, i.e. different <code>cp</code> values.
The option <code>plotly = TRUE</code> lets us visualize these paths
interactively to better understand which covariates seem to have robust
importance in the model.</p>

visualize the proportion of trees in the forest that use each covariate
for splits in the model. As we regularize more, only the truly causal

<p>After finding the causal parent of the response, one might be
interested in the partial functional dependence of
<math display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mi>Y</mi><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">Y</annotation></semantics></math>
on the causal parents. If we want to intervene in a system, we need to
not only know where to intervene but also how to intervene in order to
get the desired response. For that, we first prune the forest to remove
any residual spurious correlation and get optimal predictive power. For
that, <code><a href="../reference/regPath.SDForest.html">regPath()</a></code> also contains the out-of-bag prediction
errors for different regularizations. <code><a href="../reference/plotOOB.html">plotOOB()</a></code> visualizes
both the mean squared error (oob.MSE) and the spectral loss (oob.SDE)
that we minimize. The minimal out-of-bag error lets us choose the
optimal <code>cp</code> value to prune the forest.</p>

<p>Now, to distil the partial functional dependence of the response on
the causal parents, we use partial dependence plots in
<code><a href="../reference/partDependence.html">partDependence()</a></code> <span class="citation">(Friedman
2001)</span>. For that, we vary the value of one covariate while fixing
the others to the ones that we actually observe in the data. As
representative partial conditional dependence, we plot the mean over
these individual response curves in addition to a few sample
individuals.</p>
