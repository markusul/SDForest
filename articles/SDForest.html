<p>Here, we show the functionality of an SDForest and how you can use it
to screen for causal parents of a continuous response in a large set of
observed covariates, even in the presence of hidden confounding. We also
provide methods to asses the functional partial dependence of the
response on the causal parents.</p>
<p>We show the functionalities with simulated data from a confounded
model with one true causal parents of <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span>, see
<code><a href="../reference/simulate_data_nonlinear.html">simulate_data_nonlinear()</a></code>.
<code>vignette("realWorld")</code> shows an example using real data.</p>

<p>Given the estimated causal function, the first question we might want
to answer is which of the covariates are the causal parents of the
response. If we intervene on the causal parents, we expect the response
to change. For that, we can estimate the functional dependency of <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> on <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(\widehat{f(X)}\)</span> and examine which
covariates are important in this function. We can directly compare the
importance pattern of the deconfounded estimator to the classical random
forest estimated by <a href="https://imbs-hl.github.io/ranger/" class="external-link">ranger</a>. This comparison to
the plain counterpart always gives a feeling of the strength of
confounding. If no confounding exists, <code><a href="../reference/SDForest.html">SDForest()</a></code> and
<code><a href="http://imbs-hl.github.io/ranger/reference/ranger.html" class="external-link">ranger::ranger()</a></code> should result in similar models.</p>
<p>In the graph below, we see the variable importance
<code><a href="../reference/varImp.SDForest.html">varImp()</a></code> of the deconfounded random forest against the
plain random forest. The scale has no meaning, but we see how the true
causal parents in red is getting a clear higher variable importance for
the SDForest. The plain random forest cannot distinguish between
spurious correlation and true causation.</p>

<p>Before, we looked at the variable importance of the non-regularized
SDForest. We have two more techniques to better understand which
variables might be causally important. The first is the regularization
path <code><a href="../reference/regPath.SDForest.html">regPath()</a></code>, where we plot the variable importance
against varying regularization, i.e. different values. The option lets
us visualize these paths interactively to better understand which
covariates seem to have robust importance in the model.</p>

<p>After finding the causal parent of the response, one might be
interested in the partial functional dependence of <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> on the causal parents. If we want to
intervene in a system, we need to not only know where to intervene but
also how to intervene in order to get the desired response. For that, we
first prune the forest to remove any residual spurious correlation and
get optimal predictive power. For that, <code><a href="../reference/regPath.SDForest.html">regPath()</a></code> also
contains the out-of-bag prediction errors for different regularizations.
<code><a href="../reference/plotOOB.html">plotOOB()</a></code> visualizes both the mean squared error (oob.MSE)
and the spectral loss (oob.SDE) that we minimize. The minimal out-of-bag
error lets us choose the optimal value to prune the forest.</p>

<p>Now, to distil the partial functional dependence of the response on
the causal parents, we use partial dependence plots in
<code><a href="../reference/partDependence.html">partDependence()</a></code> <span class="citation">(Friedman
2001)</span>. For that, we vary the value of one covariate while fixing
the others to the ones that we actually observe in the data. As
representative partial conditional dependence, we plot the mean over
these individual response curves in addition to a few sample
individuals.</p>
